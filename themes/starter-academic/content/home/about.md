# About Us
We are the Philadelphia chapter of R-Ladies Global, a world-wide organization that promotes gender diversity in the R community and in data science more broadly. While our group name does have ‘R’ and ‘Ladies’ in the title, we welcome all individuals who share our values and follow our code of conduct and who have an interest in data science, regardless of proficiency with R.

Since our first meetup in January 2018, R-Ladies Philly has grown to a highly active, diverse and community-driven group, with:  

 - Over 1,000 members
 -  Informal monthly meetups that are skills-focused, free, and focused on interdisciplinary statistical and coding methods
 - A quarterly networking happy hour series
 - Real-world data analytic projects that promote group work and help local nonprofits
 - Collaborative engagements with other local data science groups
 - Monthly code and coffee gettogethers
 - A [mentor/speaker directory](https://rladiesphilly.shinyapps.io/mentorship/)

We are always looking for more ways to grow and for new data approaches to try! Connect with us via the R-Ladies Philly [Slack](https://bit.ly/join-rladies-slack-2020), Email [philly@rladies.org](mailto:philly@rladies.org) or better yet, come to one of our [Meetup events](https://meetup.com/rladies-philly)!
