<h1>Our May Event!</h1>
<p>The May R-Ladies meetup took place on May 16, 2018 at Drexel’s LeBow School of Business. Thanks for hosting us again, Drexel, and thanks to our sponsors Datacamp and the R consortium!</p>
<p>Our topic for May was version control using the popular resources Git and GitHub, and we focused on integrating version control with R.</p>

<div id="intro" class="section level1">
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Darina and I started with an example to illustrate the utility of version control in collaborating on a document or project over time.</p>
<p>Many popular word processing software packages employ “track changes” as a way to edit a document or share with others for editing or feedback.</p>
<p>However, using something like track changes for version control is problematic!</p>

</div>
<p>In order to reference previous versions of a document, we would have to go through comment by comment to examine the changes a single collaborator made at a single point in time, or else revert back to the original version of the document and lose all changes!</p>
<p>We turned to the whiteboard to demonstrate how you can use Git to keep track of the evolution of a document or project over time, and how you can use GitHub to collaborate with others on the evolution of a document</p>

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>After this introduction, Alice led an interactive demo so that R-Ladies Philly could practice integrating Git and GitHub with R.</p>

</div>
<p>Through this, members practiced:<br />
- configuring Git locally<br />
- creating a Git repository<br />
- committing changes<br />
- pushing work to a <a href="https://github.com/awalsh17/intro_git_live">shared repo</a> on GitHub</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_philadelphia/tree/master/May2018">Alice’s slides</a> are posted on GitHub - this is a great resource to go through if you couldn’t make it to the meeting!</p>

<div id="lightning-talk" class="section level1">
<h1>Lightning Talk</h1>
<p>We ended by showing a GitHub repo illustrating ‘real world’ use of version control with R!</p>
<p>R-Ladies Philly members Karla, Alice, Kristen, and myself recently used Git and GitHub with R to collaborate on a data analysis project for the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society.</p>
