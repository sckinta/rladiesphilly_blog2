# Our April Event!
The April R-Ladies meetup was held on April 19th at Drexel. Thanks again to Drexel for hosting us and to DataCamp and the R consortium for sponsoring us!

Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of "Text Mining with R" by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson. 

![There was a great group - including some new faces!](/img/rladiesapril2.png)

Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together. Here is an example analysis that we completed!

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
library(gutenbergr)
library(scales) 
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wordcloud)
library(reshape2)
```

```{r}
book.id <- 51713
kafka <- gutenberg_download(51713)

data(stop_words)

tidy_kafka <- kafka %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number()) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)%>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

kafka_sentiment <- tidy_kafka %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(index = linenumber %/% 10, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

# PLOT
ggplot(kafka_sentiment, aes(index, sentiment, fill = sentiment > 0)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(c("light blue","red")) + 
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Sentiment in Kafka's Metamorphosis") + 
  theme_bw()
```


Next, we had an awesome lightning talk from Darina that went into TF-IDF. TF is Term Frequency and IDF is Inverse Document Frequency. Check out her slides to learn more.
