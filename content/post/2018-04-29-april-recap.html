<h1>Our April Event!</h1>
<p>The April R-Ladies meetup was held on April 19th at Drexel. Thanks again to Drexel for hosting us and to DataCamp and the R consortium for sponsoring us!</p>
<p>Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of “Text Mining with R” by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson.</p>

<p>Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together. Here is an example analysis that we completed!</p>

<p>Next, we had an awesome lightning talk from Darina that went into TF-IDF. TF is Term Frequency and IDF is Inverse Document Frequency. Check out her slides to learn more.</p>
