<p>Shiny applications and dashboards help communicate analytics insights to both technical and non-technical audiences in an interactive and efficient way. However, debugging them is not an easy process. For 2020 October virtual meetup, 30+ data enthusiastics joined the interactive workshop led by R-Ladies Philly member <a href="https://twitter.com/yake_84">Jake Riley</a>. Jake elucidated aspects of the popular dashboard building package <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a> and demonstrated his recently published tool <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyobjects/index.html">shinyobjects</a> to debug.</p>

<h3>flexdashboard and reactivity</h3>
<p>flexdashboard leverages Rmarkdown and shiny to build a dashboard or shiny application. Instead of splitting ui and server functions, flexdashboard takes the advantage of interpretability from Rmarkdown and makes shiny code cleaner and easier to read.</p>
<p>Like shiny, flexdashboard used the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html"><strong>reactive programming model</strong></a> which involves user inputs and dynamic data/plots/titles. It can get really complicated when you have a cascade of reactive variables. It also increases the difficulty at the debugging step.</p>

<h3>shinyobjects workflow</h3>
<p>To troubleshoot reactive data, Jake developed <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyobjects/index.html">shinyobjects</a>. This R package can access reactive objects in your local environment and allow debugging R code without actually running the app. It will save you time and allow you to iterate more quickly.</p>

Do you also hate having to run the entire shiny code to see what one tiny change will look like? There's a tool you can use to debug specific sections! Check out shinyobjects by <a href="https://twitter.com/yake_84?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation">@yake_84</span></a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RStats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RStats</a> <a href="https://t.co/XNs1fi3BGr">pic.twitter.com/XNs1fi3BGr</a>

<p>The package includes 4 components at the workflow</p>
<ul>
<li><code>view_ui()</code> to see what UI components look like without running the app</li>
<li><code>load_reactive_objects()</code> to convert reactive objects to static functions</li>
<li>create a <strong>dummy input</strong> list object for users to prepopulate</li>
<li><code>convert_selection()</code> to convert code highlighted in source pane</li>
</ul>
