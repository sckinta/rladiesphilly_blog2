With the recent transition to running R-Ladies Philly workshops and events virtually, we have launched a YouTube channel, [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPque9BaFV9p0hcgImrYBzg)! We plan to share recordings of our events whenever possible.

If you are so inclined, please subscribe and check out the recordings from our May and June workshops. While you are there, you can also find channels from other R-Ladies chapters from around the world.
