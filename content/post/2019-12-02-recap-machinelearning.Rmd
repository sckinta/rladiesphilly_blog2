On December 2, 2019, almost 50 data enthusiasts joined R-Ladies Philly for a workshop on machine learning in R.

The workshop was led by Trang Le. Trang is a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who has authored several R packages and applies machine learning to biomedical data. Follow her on [twitter](https://twitter.com/trang1618) and at [https://trang.page](https://trang.page).

**At a high-level, this workshop covered:**  

+ Intro to the `caret` package and why it exists
+ Live demo and exercises using a dataset of beer reviews
+ Trang's insights into good practices

## Do you even caret all?

The `caret` package was created to solve the problem of lots of modeling packages that didn't play well together. `caret` currently unifies over 200 models!

Trang suggested that you get started with the `caret` [website](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). She also reminded us that the package is not perfect. When you find issues or errors, contribute to the codebase or submit issues!

## Machine learning for beer lovers

This workshop used the beer ratings dataset available on Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/beer-ratings/data)). This data is freely available and provides a tasty example to practice on. Each review includes ratings on the appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression of a beer. Each beer review includes product and user information, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review.

Remember - *it is essential to clean your data!* Trang recommended the `skimr` package and `skim` function to quickly get a look at your dataset.

For this workshop, we used 1,000 reviews to predict the ABV (alcohol content) of beers from the reviews.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Machine learning 101: before building your models... MAKE SURE YOUR DATASET IS CLEAN. (Or, can&#39;t do the fun stuff until you&#39;ve completed your data cleaning chores) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/trang1618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@trang1618</a></p>&mdash; R-Ladies Philly (@RLadiesPhilly) <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesPhilly/status/1201655412258476032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Making some predictions...

Using 1,000 reviews from the beer review dataset, attendees practiced... 

+ Dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis
+ Fitting a support vector machine model, then tuning the parameters
+ Testing a random forest model
+ Using the unstructured text reviews to predict and then evaluating which words were the most predictive

## Closing thoughts

Trang wrapped up with a Q&A session. During this time, she discussed some comparisons between machine learning frameworks in R versus python and what "counts" as machine learning. 

## Thank you!

Thank you to all our attendees, our sponsors (Elsevier), and especially Trang!!
