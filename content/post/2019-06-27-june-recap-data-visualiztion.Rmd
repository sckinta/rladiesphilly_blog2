Data visualization is paramount to both understanding and presenting your data, whatever your data may be. For our June Meetup, R-Ladies Philly member **Jake Riley** led an interactive workshop to elucidate aspects of the popular `ggplot2` [package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and share helpful tips and best practices relevant to any R user. 

### The 2 g's in `ggplot2` - defined!
Jake explained that the architecture of visualizing data using `ggplot2` is based on the *g*rammar of *g*raphics: In `ggplot2`, just like every sentence has a **subject, verb, and noun**, every plot has a **coordinate system, geom, and aesthetics**.

This is demonstrated in the example below using the `mpg` dataset:
</center>
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

myplot <- 
  ggplot(mpg) + #set the 'subject' or coordinate system
  geom_point(aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) #add the 'verb' or geom used to show the data, and 'nouns' or aesthetics on how the geom should appear
myplot
```

But what exactly does `aes()` control in plot aesthetics? Jake clarified this by explaining that dynamic, data driven **variables** go inside the `aes()`, while constant, static **values** go outside. 
  
The following two plots show the difference between these `aes()` arguments:
</center>
```{r}
myplot.v2 <- 
  ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  labs(title = "Setting color inside `aes()`")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

myplot.v3 <- 
  ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = cty, y = hwy), color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Setting color outside `aes()`")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  myplot.v2,
  myplot.v3,
  ncol = 2
)
```
  
  
### Helpful tips, and best practices for plotting
Jake shared some tips for plotting, including:

* ordering barplots in descending (or ascending) order  
* using `facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()`  
* controlling color and size more precisely using `scale_*_identity()`  

To make your plot as visually appealing as possible, Jake additionally recommended:

* approximating the [golden ratio (1:1.6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) for plot dimensions  
* using color to highlight the most important plot features  
* choosing a color palette amenable to colorblindness

### Extensions and Addins
As a final activity, we explored [ggplot extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/ggiraph.html) and [ggplot addins](https://github.com/daattali/addinslist) and shared examples of our findings with the group
