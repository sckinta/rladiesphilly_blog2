<p>With the recent transition to running R-Ladies Philly workshops and events virtually, we have launched a YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPque9BaFV9p0hcgImrYBzg">R-Ladies Philly</a>! We plan to share recordings of our events whenever possible.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined, please subscribe and check out the recordings from our May and June workshops. While you are there, you can also find channels from other R-Ladies chapters from around the world.</p>
<p><em>For more information contact <a href="mailto:philly@rladies.org" class="email">philly@rladies.org</a></em></p>
