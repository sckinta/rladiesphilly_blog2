<p>Package development can be intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be! In this month’s workshop, <a href="https://www.pipinghotdata.com/about.html">Shannon Pileggi</a> gives us a step by step guide for how to get started, and shares her experience with “usethis”, “devtools” and various handy functions for package development. This workshop, suitable for beginner to intermediate R users, aims to help participants develop a working, well-documented package, and provides insights into the files and file structure required for R packages. A familiarity with functions, pipe and tidyverse is helpful.</p>

First step… usethis::create_package(‘path/packagename’)! Then you can take a look at the DESCRIPTION file… R is smart enough to populate some of this information for you if you have it in your Rprofile - try usethis::edit_r_profile() <a href="https://t.co/x0Oi65rvPC">pic.twitter.com/x0Oi65rvPC</a>
