<h2>“6 R Packages to Add to Your Workflow” by Jinyi Kuang</h2>
<p>We kicked off the event with a lightning talk by Jinyi Kuang. Her slides are available on her GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/jinyikuang000/r-ladies-talk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Jinyi highlighted 6 packages that can boost your productivity in R. For example, <a href="https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf?_ga=2.144655730.634097270.1588348056-452179466.1588348056">plotly</a> allows you to make beautiful interactive graphics.</p>

<h2>Intro to R Workshop by Tess Cherlin</h2>
<p>Before the workshop, Tess created this <a href="https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_philadelphia/blob/master/2020_06/R%20Studio%20Download%20Tutorial%202020.pdf">useful resource</a> to guide new R users through how to install R and RStudio for the first time.</p>
<p>The content for the main workshop is available online <a href="https://github.com/alldayscientess/RLadies">here</a>.</p>
<p>The example data for this workshop were taken from the <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/data">Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering Report</a>.</p>
