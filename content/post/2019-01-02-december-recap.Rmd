We collaborated with [Women in Kaggle Philly](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/) to provide an Introduction to Machine Learning (ML).  

ML is the science of getting computers to learn from data without explicit programming. ML has led to advances in speech recognition, tumor identification, self-driving cars, and many other arenas. You probably interact with ML every day!  

This meetup featured a lightning talk introducing some key concepts followed by a hands-on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition tutorial.  

## A brief introduction to Machine Learning  

Tamera Lanham, a data scientist at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/), gave a lightning talk introducing ML. Her slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8asc4-Enbid575XLmWFSrhoHJxdWxqBi3E0vysq6Vo/edit?usp=sharing).  

Tamera discussed the distinction between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning:  

* **Supervised** learning involves labelled data. A model can be fitted to this data in order to generate predictions about new data.  
* **Unsupervised** learning does not involve labelled data. Instead, the model infers structure within the data.  

Tamera overviewed some model types including tree-based models and neural networks. A main take-away was that we shouldn't be afraid to try out some ML techniques!

## Kaggle competition tutorial  

Ran Liu, [Women in Kaggle Philly](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/) organiser and [PhD Candidate in Sociology at Penn](https://sites.google.com/site/ranliusoci/), led the Kaggle competition tutorial. Before delving into code, Ran introduced **Kaggle** and **Women in Kaggle Philly**:  

*   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a data science and machine learning online community. Kaggle is famous for hosting machine learning competitions, but it also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench, and educational resources for AI education.  
*   [Women in Kaggle Philly](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/) is a meetup group for women interested in participating and exploring Kaggle competitions within an inclusive and supportive environment. They organize talks, workshops, and social events regularly.

Ran prepared this [R notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ranliu/r-ladies-philly-intro-to-machine-learning-meetup/notebook) which we worked through during the tutorial.  

We covered the following steps:  

1. **Data Loading** <span style="color:purple">importing the data</span>    
2. **A Very Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** <span style="color:purple">understanding the data</span>    
3. **Data Preprocessing** <span style="color:purple">AKA data cleaning/wrangling</span>    
4. **Simple Feature Engineering** <span style="color:purple">creating new predictor variables from the data</span>    
5. **Modeling & Evaluation** <span style="color:purple">fitting your model and seeing how well it does (we used Lasso regression and XGBoost)</span>    
6. **Creating Submission File** <span style="color:purple">submitting your prediction to the competition</span>    

We recommend taking a look at Ran's [R notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ranliu/r-ladies-philly-intro-to-machine-learning-meetup/notebook). It includes R code for each of these steps interleaved with helpful explanations and links to supplementary material.
