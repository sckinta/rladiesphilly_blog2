<p>We collaborated with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/">Women in Kaggle Philly</a> to provide an Introduction to Machine Learning (ML).</p>
<p>ML is the science of getting computers to learn from data without explicit programming. ML has led to advances in speech recognition, tumor identification, self-driving cars, and many other arenas. You probably interact with ML every day!</p>
<p>This meetup featured a lightning talk introducing some key concepts followed by a hands-on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competition tutorial.</p>

<h2>A brief introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Tamera Lanham, a data scientist at <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/">Elsevier</a>, gave a lightning talk introducing ML. Her slides are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q8asc4-Enbid575XLmWFSrhoHJxdWxqBi3E0vysq6Vo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Tamera discussed the distinction between <strong>supervised</strong> and <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised</strong> learning involves labelled data. A model can be fitted to this data in order to generate predictions about new data.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised</strong> learning does not involve labelled data. Instead, the model infers structure within the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tamera overviewed some model types including tree-based models and neural networks. A main take-away was that we shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to try out some ML techniques!</p>

Tamera Lanham is a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScientist?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DataScientist</a> and machine learning expert! We are demystifying concepts like neural networks. You don‚Äôt need to understand in depth to jump in! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RLadies</a> <a href="https://t.co/FzE6qgnFXu">pic.twitter.com/FzE6qgnFXu</a>

<h2>Kaggle competition tutorial</h2>
<p>Ran Liu, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/">Women in Kaggle Philly</a> organiser and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ranliusoci/">PhD Candidate in Sociology at Penn</a>, led the Kaggle competition tutorial. Before delving into code, Ran introduced <strong>Kaggle</strong> and <strong>Women in Kaggle Philly</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is a data science and machine learning online community. Kaggle is famous for hosting machine learning competitions, but it also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench, and educational resources for AI education.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/">Women in Kaggle Philly</a> is a meetup group for women interested in participating and exploring Kaggle competitions within an inclusive and supportive environment. They organize talks, workshops, and social events regularly.</li>

Very excited about collaborating with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womeninkaggle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#womeninkaggle</a> for this meetup - <a href="https://twitter.com/kaggle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation">@kaggle</span></a> is a resource to learn and practice machine learning. Why? People like Ran share their knowledge and skills üëçüèª <a href="https://t.co/ecOUh14ik7">pic.twitter.com/ecOUh14ik7</a>

<p>Ran prepared this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ranliu/r-ladies-philly-intro-to-machine-learning-meetup/notebook">R notebook</a> which we worked through during the tutorial.</p>
<p>We covered the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Data Loading</strong> <span style="color:purple">importing the data</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>A Very Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> <span style="color:purple">understanding the data</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong> <span style="color:purple">AKA data cleaning/wrangling</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Simple Feature Engineering</strong> <span style="color:purple">creating new predictor variables from the data</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Modeling &amp; Evaluation</strong> <span style="color:purple">fitting your model and seeing how well it does (we used Lasso regression and XGBoost)</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Creating Submission File</strong> <span style="color:purple">submitting your prediction to the competition</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend taking a look at Ran‚Äôs <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ranliu/r-ladies-philly-intro-to-machine-learning-meetup/notebook">R notebook</a>. It includes R code for each of these steps interleaved with helpful explanations and links to supplementary material.</p>
