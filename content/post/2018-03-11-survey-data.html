<h2>Why do a new member survey?</h2>
<p>One of the goals of R-Ladies Philly is for the group to be focused on the needs and interests of its members. With this goal in mind, we created a survey to query members about meeting logistics and R experience level. This survey also provided a mechanism to collect emails in order to invite new members to our Slack channel.</p>
<p>If you want to join us and fill out the survey, you can find it here: <a href="http://bit.ly/rladies-survey" class="uri">http://bit.ly/rladies-survey</a></p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to share the results. Because this is R-Ladies, I also wanted to analyze and visualize the data in <em>R</em>!</p>

<div id="step-one-get-the-data-from-google-to-r" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Step One:</strong> Get the data from google to R</h2>
<p>There are probably many ways to accomplish getting the data from a google form into R. The first things that came to my mind were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download a file from google to some local place on my computer</li>
<li>Use an R package to pull the data from google docs to R</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to try the googlesheets package: <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets" class="uri">https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets</a></p>
<p>I found this package very user-friendly and easy to figure out. You will see below that a couple commands get the job done.</p>
<p>What I did here is not fully automated. I did visit the survey on docs.google.com and click the option to “View responses in Sheets”. In the resulting sheet, I removed email addresses to anonymize the respondents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(googlesheets)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))</code></pre>
<p>The first step is to authenticate with google and see what sheets you have available. The following will open a browser window and ask you to tell google you want to look at your data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_sheets &lt;- gs_ls()</code></pre>
<p>I had made a sheet called, “survey_responses_03_09_2018”, that holds the survey data. You can access it through the key: “1g3-M2fMF7_7pLGv7MttZ0DFjr9jd8jr6zQFxJAccEnw”</p>
<p>You can create the googlesheets objects with gs_key() and then pipe this to a data frame with gs_read().</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rsurvey &lt;- gs_key(&quot;1g3-M2fMF7_7pLGv7MttZ0DFjr9jd8jr6zQFxJAccEnw&quot;) %&gt;%
  gs_read()</code></pre>
<p>As of March 9, there were 39 responses from the survey.</p>

<h2><strong>Step Two:</strong> Make some plots</h2>

<li>Statistics-regression, GLM, machine learning, unsupervised/supervised methods, hypothesis testing, very basic text analytics</li>
<li>As of now, I guess I’d do something on the American Community Survey package, if folks would find it useful.</li>
<li>I am afraid I don’t know enough to give a talk.</li>
<li>Factor analysis, Conjoint analysis, hierarchical linear regression with R</li>

<h2>My takeaways</h2>
<p>Thank you to all the Philly R-Ladies who took the survey!</p>
<p>Our group represents a variety of experience levels - some have never used R and some are R experts. We even had some people volunteer to help with planning and content for future events, which I am really excited about!</p>
<p>Importantly, the survey confirmed that we will continue to meet in center city or university city (thank you to MakeOffices and Drexel who have hosted us).</p>
<p>As far as when we meet, weekdays appear to be the preference, but there is also a lot of interest in a weekend meetup. Our previous events have been on Wednesdays, but we plan to mix it up so that people with conflicts every Wednesday can attend. One practical consideration I have encountered is that it is harder to find a venue for a weekend meetup. Maybe someone wants to email us at <a href="mailto:philly@rladies.org">philly@rladies.org</a> with location ideas?</p>
<p>This process got me thinking… let’s plan to do another survey at the end of the year to see how the group has evolved.</p>
