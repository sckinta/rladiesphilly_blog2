<p>On December 2, 2019, almost 50 data enthusiasts joined R-Ladies Philly for a workshop on machine learning in R.</p>
<p>The workshop was led by Trang Le. Trang is a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who has authored several R packages and applies machine learning to biomedical data. Follow her on <a href="https://twitter.com/trang1618">twitter</a> and at <a href="https://trang.page">https://trang.page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>At a high-level, this workshop covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intro to the <code>caret</code> package and why it exists</li>
<li>Live demo and exercises using a dataset of beer reviews</li>
<li>Trang’s insights into good practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Do you even caret all?</h2>
<p>The <code>caret</code> package was created to solve the problem of lots of modeling packages that didn’t play well together. <code>caret</code> currently unifies over 200 models!</p>
<p>Trang suggested that you get started with the <code>caret</code> <a href="http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html">website</a>. She also reminded us that the package is not perfect. When you find issues or errors, contribute to the codebase or submit issues!</p>

<div id="machine-learning-for-beer-lovers" class="section level2">
<h2>Machine learning for beer lovers</h2>
<p>This workshop used the beer ratings dataset available on Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/beer-ratings/data">link</a>). This data is freely available and provides a tasty example to practice on. Each review includes ratings on the appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression of a beer. Reviews include product and user information, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review.</p>
<p>Remember - <em>it is important to clean your data!</em> Trang recommended the <code>skimr</code> package and <code>skim</code> function to quickly get a look at your dataset.</p>
<p>For this workshop, we used 1,000 reviews to predict the ABV (alcohol content) of beers from the reviews.</p>

Machine learning 101: before building your models… MAKE SURE YOUR DATASET IS CLEAN. (Or, can't do the fun stuff until you've completed your data cleaning chores) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/trang1618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation">@trang1618</span></a>

<div id="making-some-predictions" class="section level2">
<h2>Making some predictions…</h2>
<p>Using 1,000 reviews from the beer review dataset, attendees practiced…</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis</li>
<li>Fitting a support vector machine model, then tuning the parameters</li>
<li>Testing a random forest model</li>
<li>Using the unstructured text reviews to predict and then evaluating which words were the most predictive</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="closing-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Trang wrapped up with a Q&amp;A session. During this time, she discussed some comparisons between machine learning frameworks in R versus python and what “counts” as machine learning.</p>

<div id="thank-you" class="section level2">
<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>Thank you to all our attendees, our sponsors (Elsevier), and especially Trang!!</p>
